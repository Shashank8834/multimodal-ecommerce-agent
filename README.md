# multimodal-ecommerce-agent
🛍️ Multimodal E-commerce AI Agent
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for building a multimodal AI agent that enhances the e-commerce experience using a combination of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). The agent is designed to handle image-based product classification, text-based search, and summarization of product data, and integrates these tasks into a complete AI pipeline.

🔧 Features
🖼️ Image Classifier: Classifies product images into categories using deep learning (CNN-based models).

🔍 Product Search: Enables product search using NLP techniques on product descriptions and titles.

✍️ NLP Summarizer: Summarizes long product descriptions to improve readability and display.

🔄 Full Pipeline: Combines all the components into an end-to-end multimodal AI system.

📁 Repository Structure

README.md	This project overview and usage guide.

📦 Requirements
Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab

Libraries:
torch, transformers, scikit-learn, sentence-transformers, opencv-python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

Install with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Create a requirements.txt file if you haven’t yet)

🚀 Getting Started
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Run the notebooks in the following order:

1_image_classifier.ipynb

2_product_search.ipynb

3_nlp_summarizer.ipynb

4_full_pipeline.ipynb

📊 Example Use Case
A customer uploads a photo of a product and enters a few keywords.
The AI agent:

Classifies the product image

Searches similar products using text descriptions

Summarizes lengthy product details for better readability

📌 Future Improvements
Add multilingual support for NLP tasks.

Deploy as a web API using FastAPI or Flask.

Integrate recommendation systems.

Use CLIP or BLIP for better multimodal performance.
